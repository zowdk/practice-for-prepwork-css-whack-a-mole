## Objective

The objective was to use CSS positioning, hover effects, transitions and overflow to create a a Whack-A-Mole game with provided images.  

## Implementation Highlights

### Make it responsive

 - So that all the moles can be seen and the game can still be played on smaller screens.
 - To practice using CSS grid and media queries.


<!--  ![Whack-A-Mole](img/responsive-thumbnail.png) { width: 320px } -->
 <img src="./img/responsive-thumbnail.png" alt="whack-a-mole at smaller screens" width="350"/>


### Expanded playing field

- To make use of the entire screen and for some added challenge.
